Directions:
Create a new Angular application
In the AppComponent
Display the movie posters of 4 movie flops
Place a button for each one to vote for it
When a button is clicked, disable all of the buttons
Also, display a message next to the chosen poster that says "Chosen!"
Bonus Challenge - Enable changing your vote
Change the text of the clicked button to "Unvote" and don't disable it
If it is clicked again to "unvote" then re-enable the other buttons, remove the "Chosen!" message and change the button text back to "Vote" so that you can change your vote.
